However, Soundtoys plugins are not cheap, and they require a license to run on your computer. If you want to use them without paying or activating them, you will need to crack them. Cracking is a process of bypassing the copy protection and modifying the plugin files to make them work without authorization. This is illegal and unethical, and it may harm your computer or expose you to malware.
 
Therefore, we do not recommend cracking Soundtoys plugins or any other software. Instead, you should support the developers and buy their products legally. You can also try their free trial versions or their free plugins like Little Plate and Sie-Q. However, if you are still curious about how to crack Soundtoys 64 bit AU plugins for Mac, here is a general overview of the steps involved:
 
1. Download the Soundtoys installer from their official website or any other source. Make sure it is compatible with your Mac OS version and your DAW.
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions. Do not launch any of the plugins or register them.
3. Download a crack tool that can patch Soundtoys plugins. There are many crack tools available online, but some of them may be fake or malicious. Be careful and do your research before downloading anything.
4. Run the crack tool and select the Soundtoys plugins that you want to crack. The crack tool will scan your system and locate the plugin files. It will then modify them to remove the license check and replace it with a fake one.
5. Restart your computer and launch your DAW. You should be able to use the cracked Soundtoys plugins without any limitations or errors.

Note that cracking Soundtoys plugins may have some risks and drawbacks. For example:

- You may not be able to update the plugins or access their online features.
- You may experience bugs, crashes, or compatibility issues with your DAW or other plugins.
- You may violate the terms of service of Soundtoys and your DAW, and face legal consequences.
- You may lose your data or damage your system if the crack tool contains malware or viruses.

Therefore, we strongly advise you to avoid cracking Soundtoys plugins or any other software. Instead, you should respect the intellectual property rights of the developers and pay for their products if you want to use them. This way, you will support their work and encourage them to create more amazing audio effects for us.
