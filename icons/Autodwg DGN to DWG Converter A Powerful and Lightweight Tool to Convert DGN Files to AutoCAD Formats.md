If you are a CAD user, you may have encountered DGN files that need to be converted to DWG format for compatibility or editing purposes. DGN files are supported by Bentley Systems' MicroStation CAD programs, and are used for various construction projects, such as buildings, highways, bridges, etc. DWG files are the native format for several CAD packages, including AutoCAD, DraftSight, IntelliCAD, and more. DWG files contain all the information a user enters, such as designs, geometric data, maps, photos, etc.
