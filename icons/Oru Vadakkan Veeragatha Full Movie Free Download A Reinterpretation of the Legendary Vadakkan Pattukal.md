Chanthu also falls in love with Unniyarcha (Madhavi), Aromal's sister and a fearless warrior woman.

Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha is not just a historical film, but also a psychological drama that explores the themes of identity, loyalty, honour, love and revenge. The film challenges the conventional portrayal of Chandu as a villain and Aromal as a hero, and instead presents them as complex and flawed human beings. The film also questions the validity and reliability of oral traditions and legends that are often biased and distorted by time and memory.
 
The film was a critical and commercial success, and received widespread acclaim from critics and audiences alike. The film was praised for its brilliant screenplay by M. T. Vasudevan Nair, who won his third National Film Award for Best Screenplay. The film also showcased the acting prowess of Mammootty, who delivered one of his career-best performances as Chandu. He won his second National Film Award for Best Actor for his nuanced and subtle portrayal of the tragic hero. The film also featured excellent performances by the supporting cast, especially Balan K. Nair, Suresh Gopi, Madhavi and Captain Raju.
 
The film also won several other awards and accolades, such as the Kerala State Film Award for Best Film with Popular Appeal and Aesthetic Value, Best Director (Hariharan), Best Actor (Mammootty), Best Supporting Actor (Balan K. Nair), Best Cinematography (K. Ramachandra Babu), Best Editor (M. S. Mani) and Best Sound Recordist (Devadas). The film also won the Filmfare Award for Best Malayalam Film.
 
Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha is regarded to be one of the greatest Malayalam films ever made and is considered a landmark film in Malayalam film history. Following its release, Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha has attained cult status in Malayalam cinema and receives re-runs on television channels. The film has also inspired several remakes and adaptations in other languages, such as Veeraputhran (2011) in Malayalam, Urumi (2011) in Malayalam and Hindi, and Pulimurugan (2016) in Malayalam.
